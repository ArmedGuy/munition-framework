Great, lets just talk through a quick few things that will help both you and us.


### Coding Conventions

 * Prefix methods and accessors with _ if they are private or protected. (Protected can an be exception sometimes)
 * Use camelCase naming convention.
 * 2 spaces for tabs.
 * Brackets [] for arrays, NOT array()
 * No @ error suppression, use try/catch

### Remember the Blocks

Try to separate features from each other as much as possible, and try not to create code dependencies.

Thats all for now. Its pretty early though, so schtuff might change overtime.
