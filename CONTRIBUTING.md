Great, lets just talk through a quick few things that will help both you and us.


### Coding Conventions

 * Prefix methods and accessors with _ if they are private or protected. (Protected can an be exception sometimes)
 * **Naming Conventions**
    - PascalCase for classes
    - camelCase for class functions, class variables
    - lower_case for static functions, global functions, static variables, global variables
    - UPPER_CASE for constants
    - **NOTE:** Some exceptions occur, such as Rails compability on the QueryBuilder class
 * 2 spaces for tabs.
 * Brackets [] for arrays, NOT array()
 * No @ error suppression, use try/catch

### Remember the Blocks

Try to separate features from each other as much as possible, and try not to create code dependencies.

Thats all for now. Its pretty early though, so schtuff might change overtime.
